# CARS (Context-Aware Retrieval Sampling) Anki Addon

This is the official repository for the CARS (Context-Aware Retrieval Sampling) Anki addon.

CARS is an ambitious project that aims to shift the focus of spaced repetition from optimizing individual cards (like FSRS) to optimizing the context and structure of learning. It helps users understand and review topics as a whole, rather than just isolated facts.

## Key Features

*   **Card Vectorization & Clustering:** Automatically analyzes your cards and groups them into meaningful topic clusters.
*   **Two-Phase Scheduling:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Cruise):** Review cards on a "cluster" basis.
    *   **Phase 2 (Sprint):** An intensive, weakness-focused review mode that activates as your deadline (e.g., an exam date) approaches.
*   **Learning Transference:** When you successfully review a card, CARS gives a small "bonus" to related cards within the same topic cluster, reflecting the idea that learning one concept makes related concepts easier.
*   **FSRS Integration:** CARS is designed to work on top of the FSRS addon, augmenting its scheduling capabilities.

This project is currently under development.
